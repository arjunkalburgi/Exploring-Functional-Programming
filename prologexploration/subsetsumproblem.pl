% Question 4 (3 marks) - Subset Sum Problem (SSP)

% An important problem in cryptography is the so-called Subset Sum Problem. Given a list of integers L (more formally, called a multiset - elements in it may be repeated) and an integer N, determine whether there exists a subset S of L, such that the sum of the integers in S equals N. Also see this description. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem 

% In this question, you will be using CLP(FD) to solve the problem.  That is, you state what constraints must be satisfied and let the CLP(FD) solver solve it. 

% Test your solution with example queries in this file https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/pluginfile.php/4256602/mod_assign/intro/tests-SSP.pl , and report which ones can be solved within 2 minutes (if not the lab machine, describe your machine).
