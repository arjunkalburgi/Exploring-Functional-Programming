% Question 5 (4 marks):  Graph Coloring

% The problem is: Given a graph in terms of nodes and arcs and a number of colors, determine whether there exists a coloring such that each node is colored with exactly one color  and any two nodes that are adjacent to each other must be colored with different colors. 

% We assume that nodes are named as 0,1,2,..., and arc/2 is a predicate for arcs, colors are given as red, blue, yellow, green, etc. The following is an input instance of the graph coloring problem.  Note that nodes are implicitly given in arcs. 

% arc(0,1). arc(0,2). arc(0,3). arc(1,2). arc(1,3). arc(1,4). arc(2,3). arc(2,4). arc(3,4). 

% color(red). color(blue). color(yellow). 

% This graph coloring problem does not have a solution. 

% Later, TA will provide some hints and possibly a sketched solution.
